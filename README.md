# What's this ?
My .vim folder with every plugin and my own annotated .vimrc file

# Installation
- Clone this repo in your Home folder
- Launch `vim` and execute `:PluginInstall`
- Exit and compile [YouCompleteMe](https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe#ubuntu-linux-x64) (*Warning*: CMake and Python dependencies)
- Add a *.vimrc* file in your home folder linking to my .vimrc: `echo source ~/.vim/.vimrc > ~/.vimrc`
- Enjoy !
